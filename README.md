# Havoc Source

Havoc Source is a game engine based off of Source Engine (Technically Source SDK 2013) that is made to be more modern and easier to use. The engine is completely FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) and it can be used for alot of 3D Games. [More Info](docs/index.md)

# NOTE

Havoc Source has not released yet. Please do not beg to me for a license, you won't get one unless you wait for it to be done.
